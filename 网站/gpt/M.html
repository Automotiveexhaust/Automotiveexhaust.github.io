    <h3>Methological overview</h3>

        To mitigate car exhaust pollution, research identifies two key strategies: firstly, treating emitted exhaust
        through chemical and physical methods to reduce harmfulness, and secondly, enhancing fuel efficiency to extend

        vehicle operation time without increasing pollutant output. These methods focus on both direct pollution
        reduction and indirect control through improved fuel usage.

        The article introduces a novel internal combustion engine design featuring an auxiliary piston mechanism to
        enhance efficiency. This approach involves rapidly reducing the combustion chamber contents in a small cylinder,
        effectively reducing the chamber's volume. The structure, while simple and adaptable to high-speed operations,
        reaches its efficiency limits due to the detonation limits of gasoline. The key innovation lies in the auxiliary
        piston's additional movement during the intake and exhaust processes, significantly boosting engine efficiency.

        The study highlights the use of nano-titanium dioxide in road construction as a method to treat car exhaust
        pollution. This material, a wide bandgap semiconductor, when exposed to sunlight, becomes a catalyst that
        <img src="/image/2041700052622_.pic.jpg" alt="描述图片内容" class="embedded-image">
        decomposes harmful gases. The effectiveness of titanium dioxide increases with its reduced size, enhancing its
        photocatalytic activity. This not only aids in degrading harmful gases on road surfaces but also improves the
        high-temperature performance of asphalt roads without any adverse effects, offering a dual benefit of
        environmental protection and road material enhancement.

        The article discusses the Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system in gasoline engines as a means to control
        emission pollution. EGR works by recirculating a portion of the exhaust gases back into the engine cylinder to
        lower combustion temperatures and reduce NOx emissions. The EGR system, controlled by the Engine Control Unit,
        adjusts the flow of exhaust gases based on the engine's operating conditions. Additionally, the article
        <img src="/image/2151700133576_.pic.jpg" class="image" alt="描述图片内容" class="embedded-image">
        emphasizes the vital role of the three-way catalytic converter, which further improves fuel efficiency and
        reduces emissions by transforming harmful gases like CO, HC, and NOx into harmless substances like nitrogen,
        oxygen, water, and carbon dioxide. This dual approach of EGR and catalytic conversion significantly contributes
        to reducing automotive air pollution.
